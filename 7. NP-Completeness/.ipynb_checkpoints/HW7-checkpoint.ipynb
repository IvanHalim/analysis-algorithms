    "   -  __If Y is NP-complete then so is X.__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      False. X can either be NP or NP-complete. X is NP-complete if and only if all other problems in NP reduces to X.\n",

    "   -  __If X is NP-complete then so is X.__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      False. If X is not verifiable in polynomial time then X is NP-hard.\n",

    "   \n",
    "       Given an integer y, does y have any factors other than one and itself?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For this exercise, you may assume that COMPOSITE is in NP, and you will be comparing it to the well-known NP-complete problem SUBSET-SUM:\n",

    "   -  __SUBSET-SUM $\\leq_p$ COMPOSITE__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      This statement is False because COMPOSITE is not necessarily NP-complete just because it is in NP. If we can show that SUBSET-SUM reduces to COMPOSITE in polynomial time then this statement is True.\n",

    "   -  __If there is an $O(n^3)$ algorithm for SUBSET-SUM then there is a polynomial time algorithm for COMPOSITE__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Because SUBSET-SUM is NP-complete and COMPOSITE is in NP, then COMPOSITE reduces to SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time. Since there is a polynomial algorithm for SUBSET-SUM then there must be a polynomial time algorithm for COMPOSITE.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   -  __If there is a polynomial algorithm for COMPOSITE, then P = NP.__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      This statement is only True if COMPOSITE is NP-complete. So far it has not been proven that COMPOSITE is NP-complete.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   -  __If P $\\neq$ NP, then no problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time.__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      If P $\\neq$ NP, some problems in NP may still be solvable in polynomial time. The only conclusion you can draw is that no NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time.\n",

    "      \n",
    "      We now show that graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path from $u$ to $adj(u)$.\n",

In other words the number $1, 2, .., k$ represent the $k$ colors and adjacent vertices must have different colors. The decision problem K-COLOR asks if a graph can be colored with at most $K$ colors.\n",
