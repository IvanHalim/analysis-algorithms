    "      \n",
    "      The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is simple, a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected. So two disjoint subsets of vertices must be connected to make a __Spanning__ Tree. And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a __Minimum__ Spanning Tree.\n",

    "      __Algorithm:__\n",
    "      1. Create a set _mstSet_ that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.\n",
    "      2. Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first.\n",
    "      3. While _mstSet_ doesn’t include all vertices,\n",
    "         1. Pick a vertex $u$ which is not in _mstSet_ and has minimum key value.\n",
    "         2. Include $u$ to _mstSet_.\n",
    "         3. Update key value of all adjacent vertices of $u$. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex $v$, if weight of edge $u-v$ is less than the previous key value of $v$, update the key value as weight of $u-v$.\n",

    "   2. __If each edge weight is increased by 1 will this change the minimum spanning tree? Explain.__\n",
    "   \n",
    "      Increasing the edge weights by 1 will not change the minimum spanning tree. Although the edge weights change, for each edge in the graph, its relative weight compared to all the other edge weights will still be the same. Thus, the MST does not change."

Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree. Like Prim’s MST, we generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with given source as root. We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in shortest path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in shortest path tree. At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex which is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.\n",
